# Gen3 Stereo on host

> Your device needs to have calibration stored to work with this example

This experiment demonstrates how [stereo pipeline works](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/stereo_depth/#internal-block-diagram-of-stereodepth-node) on the OAK device (using depthai). It rectifies mono frames (receives from the OAK camera) and then uses `cv2.StereoSGBM` to calculate the disparity on the host. It also colorizes the disparity and shows it to the user.

[SSIM score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) is used to comapre the similarity between the disparity map calculated using `cv2.StereoSGBM` and the disparity map generated on the OAK camera.

> While SSIM can provide a general measure of structural similarity, it might not perfectly capture the similarity of depth maps, as small absolute differences in depth can lead to lower scores even if the overall structure is similar. You can visually evaluate the depth maps in the Visualizer.

## Usage

You can run the experiment fully on device (`STANDALONE` mode) or using your your computer as host (`PERIPHERAL` mode).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                      Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
```

### Peripheral Mode

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. You can find more information about the supported devices and the set up instructions in our [Documentation](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/hardware).
Moreover, you need to prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run the app using the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Standalone Mode

Running the example in the [Standalone mode](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/standalone/), app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the [oakctl](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/tools/oakctl/) command-line tool (enables host-device interaction) as:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://oakctl-releases.luxonis.com/oakctl-installer.sh)"
```

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file.
