# RGB-Depth frames with detections

This demo will display RGB and depth frames side-by-side and overlay bounding boxes with spatial coordiantes from YoloV4-tiny object detector.

## Installation
Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. You can find more information about the supported devices and the set up instructions in our [Documentation](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/hardware).
Moreover, you need to prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the experiment fully on device (`STANDALONE` mode) or using your your computer as host (`PERIPHERAL` mode).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                      Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
```

### Peripheral Mode

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

#### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Standalone Mode

Running the example in the [Standalone mode](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/standalone/), app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the [oakctl](https://rvc4.docs.luxonis.com/software/tools/oakctl/) command-line tool (enables host-device interaction) as:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://oakctl-releases.luxonis.com/oakctl-installer.sh)"
```

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the experiment with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file.
